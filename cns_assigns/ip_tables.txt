TCP traffic on that port to come in.
sudo iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport ssh -j ACCEPT

let's allow all incoming web traffic
sudo iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 80 -j ACCEPT

Blocking Traffic
sudo iptables -A INPUT -j DROP
sudo iptables -L

Editing iptables
sudo iptables -I INPUT 1 -i lo -j ACCEPT
sudo iptables -L

we will list iptables in greater detail.
sudo iptables -L -v

//Allow traffic on ICMP port
sudo iptables -A INPUT -p icmp -j ACCEPT
now list the rules again..
sudo iptables -L

//Dropping icmp packets
try to ping ur neighbour machine
ping 192.168.92.17
u can see the response packets received.
Now block incoming icmp packets from the neighbour using command:
sudo iptables -A INPUT -p icmp -j DROP
list the rule:
sudo iptables -L
try to ping ur neighbour machine again
ping 192.168.92.17
u can not see receive icmp echo reply packets

//restrict outgoing icmp
sudo iptables -A OUTPUT -p icmp -j DROP
List the rule:
sudo iptables -L
now try to ping neighbour
ping 192.168.92.17

flush all rules and try to ping neighbor
Blocking TCP port traffic will not allow u to browse the Internet
sudo iptables -A INPUT -p tcp -j DROP
